## Title:

Metadata for Science with (bio)schemas

## Description:

Metadata can be used to describe research outcomes (e.g., reports,
datasets, software, tutorials, management plans). Thanks to metadata
we can have generic (e.g., search engines) and specific (i.e.,
tailored to a domain or outcome type) registries where we can find
information and get recommendations on material relevant to our
research (i.e., information retrieval systems). We have plenty of
metadata for publications reporting methods and results but not enough
for other research outcomes. We need more metadata and, by the time
being, most of it need to be manually collected (think of the fields
that you fill in when submitting a paper). Bioschemas provides a
lightweight option to add structured markup to webpages, markup that
could be used by registries to collect and aggregate metadata and
provide services on top of it. This project offers the possibility of
working on any of the following fronts: (i) adding markup to your own
objects and connecting them with each other, (ii) creating tools that
consume markup, (iii) discussing what objects are not yet covered by
Bioschemas but should be there (e.g., training datasets for machine
learning and machine learning models), (iv) creating crosswalks for
those additional objects. We are particularly interested in using
metadata for machine learning and software management plans, and
exploring how metadata can be used beyond FAIR to, for instance,
(partially) cover reproducibility and other *ilities.
