## Title:

The ELIXIR::GA4GH Cloud - Global Engagement

## Description:

The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH), an international
standard-setting organization bringing together opinion leaders in
academia and industry, has proposed a set of community standards for
data access and processing in the cloud. Based on these standards, the
ELIXIR Cloud & AAI community, a GA4GH Driver Project, is developing
the ELIXIR::GA4GH Cloud, a FAIR federated cloud environment for
large-scale data analytics, as well as a software development kit
(SDK) of native cloud components enabling developers and systems
administrators to easily integrate with the ELIXIR::GA4GH Cloud or set
up their own private, public or hybrid cloud environments that are
interoperable with other GA4GH standards-based clouds.  Currently, the
ELIXIR::GA4GH Cloud enables researchers to run CWL, Nextflow and
Snakemake workflows on different HPC and Kubernetes clusters across
various European nodes. Support for other workflow types/engines
(e.g., Galaxy, WDL) and commercial cloud solutions (e.g., Microsoft
Azure) is on our roadmap for 2023. For the hackathon, we propose to
increase the engagement with the global life science and healthcare
community by improving our landing page, documentation hub and
dedicated registry of compatible service instances, which have all
been recently deployed and still lack content and features.
