# Project 9

## Title:

The Middle East molecular database

## Description:

The project is aimed at a molecular database construction concerning
molecular data collected from the Middle East. The database is
supposed to store several open sub-databases containing specific types
of data, e.g. genomes, proteomes, transcriptomes, mutation information
associated with various diseases, drug resistance etc.. These
sub-databases would keep human, plant, animal, bacteria and archaea
molecular data. Main steps of project are data collection, building
and running the server with data and user-friendly interface
construction. This project idea is unique because it has no analogues
among modern biomedical databases. It will be extremely helpful for
researches in bioinformatics and natural sciences for this data
collected in one place will give brilliant opportunities for them to
perform new experiments and find hidden dependencies in a wide range
of biomedical sciences for the sake of the quality of life improvement
for the Middle East residents. Also it should be noted that this
project is very flexible; indeed, all researches might be able to add
their own data and to introduce their own sub-databases.
