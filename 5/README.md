## Title:

DNApredict

## Description:

Despite the advancement in sequencing technologies, ~98% of the genome
is usually disregarded due to the lack of interpretation
methods. Lately, deep-learning models have proven to be successful at
functionally annotating non-coding variants. Such predictive models
are collected in genomics repositories like Kipoi, yet it is still
difficult for biologists to utilize them as knowledge on programming
and on each model is still required. We aim to create a web interface
that combines different sequence-based prediction models. It allows
the user to submit a DNA sequence then get scores by various
prediction models in addition to statistics on each model and how the
score can be translated biologically.

## Theme:

reproducible workflows for data analysis and interpretation (with
focus on Middle East)
