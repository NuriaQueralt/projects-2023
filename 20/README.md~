## Title: 

mOWL: Python library for machine learning with biomedical ontologies

## Description:

mOWL is a Python library designed to work with machine learning
methods that use ontologies.  Ontologies contain formal and structured
information about a domain. In bioinformatics, the information
contained in ontologies has been widely used in machine learning to
improve tasks such as protein-fuction or gene-disease association
predictions.  mOWL is a library than standardizes the use and
manipulation of ontologies and provides funcionalities to ease their
integration in machine learning methods.  Currently, the mOWL package
is divided into 4 components:

1. **Ontology management**: normalization and reasoning, interfacing with the OWL API and automated reasoners

2. **Ontology transformation**: including methods for projecting
ontologies into graphs, text corpora, or other formats used as
precursor to machine learning;

3. **Embedding generation**: by interfacing with the knowledge graph
embedding library PyKEEN and other approaches
implemented in Python; and

4. **Embedding post-processing**: including axiom inference, node
classification, evaluation, and visualization.


The last version of mOWL is 0.1.1 and it is under constant development. For this hackathon, we have a list of potential areas in which to work on:

* **Create an inference module**: This component consists on computing scores based
