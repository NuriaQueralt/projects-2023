## Title: 

mOWL: Python library for machine learning with biomedical ontologies

## Description:

Ontologies are widely used in machine learning methods as source of background knowledge. mOWL is a Python library designed to work with ontologies as primary source of data. We implemented methods and funcionalities to integrate ontologies with machine learning methods. mOWL, in general, is composed by the following frameworks:

1. **Ontology management**: normalization and reasoning, interfacing with the OWL API and automated reasoners

2. **Ontology transformation**: including methods for projecting
ontologies into graphs, text corpora, or other formats used as
precursor to machine learning;

3. **Embedding generation**: by interfacing with the knowledge graph
embedding library PyKEEN and other approaches
implemented in Python; and

4. **Embedding post-processing**: including axiom inference, node
classification, evaluation, and visualization.

The last version of mOWL is 0.1.1. The new version is under development. For this hackathon, we have a list of potential areas in which to work on:

* **Implementation of an inference module**: This component consists on generating a general framework that computes plausability of axioms based on a embedding method.
* **Improve visualization of embeddings**: This task is focused on developing a framework to generate visual representations of learned entity embeddings.

All of our milestones for the next mOWL version can be found at: https://github.com/bio-ontology-research-group/mowl/milestones
