## Title:

Bacteria sensing in wastewater treatment processes using transformer models

## Description:

Many wastewater treatment processes make use of functional
microorganisms which are responsible for removing pollutants,
nutrients and pathogens from the wastewater. Most WWTPs are not being
operated under optimal conditions and very little is known about the
way in which microbial communities of wastewater treatment systems
interact.
 
Gaining a deeper understanding of these microbial communities in
these systems allows for them to be improved and eventually,
optimised. To find these optimal conditions conditions, we must
investigate the microbiology of these systems.
 
Long-term short memory (LSTM) neural networks have been shown to
predict the growth patterns and interactions of bacteria. As of now,
the research community has not looked at applying transformer models
to applications of this kind. Recent studies have shown that
transformer models are better at holding long term memory,
potentially making them more suitable for this application.
