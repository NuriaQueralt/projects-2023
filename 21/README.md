## Title: 

Harmonizing COVID-19 Epidemiology Ontologies

## Description:


To monitor and control the COVID-19 pandemic, learning the
epidemiological aspects with a global lens is important. However, the
epidemiology data are often discrete, siloed, and inconsistently
collected across countries or regions, especially when COVID pandemic
hits. In 2020, a COVID-19 ontology workshop was held. As a result,
COVID-19 ontology harmonization group was formed and merged 4
ontologies into 1, the Coronavirus Infectious Disease Ontology
(CIDO). During this workshop, it was discovered that two ontologies
have been developed by two groups, CEMO and GenEpiO. Harmonizing the
CEMO and GenEpiO is the continuous work for harmonizing COVID-19
ontologies.

The objectives of this Bio-Hackathon are:

1. Using previously established harmonization methodology to develop strategy to harmonize the CEMO and GenEpiO
2. CEMO model assessment
3. Comparison with/of COVID-19 ontology models: CIDO, GENEPIO, COVOC, ....
4. FAIR metrics: measure of the strength of an ontological model (I, R) in relation to the application goal(s)
   1. define strength
   2. define metrics
5. Identify the action items and goals for the year 2023.
